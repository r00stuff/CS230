# 🎮 The Gaming Room - Software Design Document Overview  

## 📋 Summary of Client and Software Requirements  

**Client:**  
The Gaming Room, a software development company specializing in creating interactive games.  

**Software Requirements:**  
The client required a **Java-based prototype** for their game *Draw It or Lose It*. The software needed to implement a **client-server architecture**, ensuring features like:  
- ✅ **User Authentication**  
- ✅ **Role-Based Authorization**  
- ✅ **RESTful API**  

The focus was on **scalability**, **security**, and **multi-platform compatibility**.

## ✍️ Reflection on the Development Process  

### 🎯 What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?  
I excelled in breaking down complex requirements into clear, actionable sections. The document's organization made it easy for technical and non-technical stakeholders to follow along.  

---

### 🛠️ What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?  
The design document acted as a **blueprint**, providing a clear roadmap and minimizing ambiguity. Defining system architecture and functionalities in advance streamlined the development process, saving time and reducing errors.

### 🔍 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?  
I interpreted the user’s needs by:  
1. Analyzing the client’s requirements.  
2. Prioritizing **security**, **scalability**, and **user experience**.  
3. Implementing features like robust authentication protocols and a RESTful API.  

**Why is it important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**  
Understanding and prioritizing user needs ensures the software solves their pain points effectively. This leads to higher usability, adoption rates, and satisfaction—key factors for a successful application.

---

### 🧠 How did you approach designing software?  
I followed a systematic approach:  
1. **Requirement Analysis** – Breaking down the client’s needs into actionable tasks.  
2. **UML Diagrams** – Creating models for the system’s components and interactions.  
3. **Modular Design** – Ensuring scalability and adaptability.  

**Future Strategies:**  
- Iterative prototyping with frequent client feedback.  
- Incorporating **Agile methodologies**, such as sprints and retrospectives, for continuous improvement.
